## Overview
I will create the requested six Markdown audit documents and place them under `/AUDITS/2025-11-30/`. The contents will reflect the deep technical audit already prepared and shown, aligned with your format requirements.

## Files to Create
1. `/AUDITS/2025-11-30/project-scope.md`
2. `/AUDITS/2025-11-30/project-scope-diff-report.md`
3. `/AUDITS/2025-11-30/project-risks.md`
4. `/AUDITS/2025-11-30/production-readiness-report.md`
5. `/AUDITS/2025-11-30/security-audit-report.md`
6. `/AUDITS/2025-11-30/refactoring-roadmap.md`

## Content Sources and Structure
- Use the six documents already generated in the previous response (full audit content), ensuring they are copied exactly into their respective files.
- Maintain clean Markdown formatting and headings.
- Ensure each file is self-contained and comprehensive per your specification.

## Steps
1. Create directory `/AUDITS/2025-11-30/` (using today’s date).
2. Write each file with the prepared content.
3. Verify paths and filenames match your spec.
4. No code changes required outside the new audit files; build/dev unaffected.

## Verification
- Confirm files exist in `/AUDITS/2025-11-30/`.
- Open each file in the IDE to verify formatting and completeness.

## Notes
- If you prefer a different date folder name, I can adjust before writing.
- I will not modify application code, configs, or migrations while adding these docs.
